name: Product Discovery
description: Use when the user runs /start-discovery, mentions validating a product idea, running the MIT framework, or opens a folder with project-state.json. Guides through the 24-step MIT Disciplined Entrepreneurship framework autonomously, generating Excel models, Word documents, and PowerPoint presentations.
version: 1.0.0

## When This Skill Activates

- User opens a folder containing `project-state.json` → resume existing project
- User runs `/start-discovery` with a product idea
- User mentions "validate my idea", "MIT framework", "product discovery", "disciplined entrepreneurship"

## Resuming an Existing Project

When `project-state.json` exists:
1. Read the file and announce current step and progress
2. If `humanActionPending: true` → read `humanActionFile`; if the template has been filled in, incorporate findings and proceed; if still blank, re-show the human action checkpoint prompt for the previous step
3. If `activePivot` is set → work inside that pivot folder, not the root
4. Continue from `currentStep` — do not repeat completed steps
5. Load any relevant agent context files

## Starting Fresh

Ask: *"What's your product idea? (1-2 sentences)"*

Create folder structure:
```
project-state.json
IDEA.md
PHASE-1-MARKET-SELECTION/deliverables/
PHASE-2-USER-RESEARCH/deliverables/
PHASE-3-VALUE-PROPOSITION/deliverables/
PHASE-4-BUSINESS-MODEL/deliverables/
PHASE-5-VALIDATION/deliverables/
PHASE-6-EXECUTION/deliverables/

## Human Checkpoint After Every Step

After completing each step, agents present a checkpoint and wait for approval before proceeding.

### Format A — Autonomous steps (no real-world action needed)

```
✅ Step N complete — [one-line summary]

📄 Deliverables: [list files created]

👉 Does this look right, or should I revise anything before continuing to Step N+1?
   → Type "yes" to continue / describe what to change
```

### Format B — Steps requiring human real-world action

Used when the human must go do something the AI cannot (interviews, conversations, surveys, decisions). A findings template file is created before the checkpoint is shown.

```
✅ Step N complete — [one-line summary]

📄 Deliverables: [list files created]

🙋 Your Actions Required:
  1. [Specific task with clear instructions]
  2. [Additional task if needed]
  ↩ Come back and paste what you found, or type "skip" to continue with AI assumptions.

👉 Ready to continue to Step N+1?
   → Type "yes" or paste your findings / describe what to change
```

**Steps that use Format B**: 3, 6, 11, 12, 15, 19, 20, 22, 23, 24

**Checkpoint response handling:**
- **"yes" / "continue"** → set `humanActionPending: false`, immediately begin next step
- **Pasted findings** → write findings into the template file, incorporate into next step's analysis, proceed
- **"skip"** → continue with AI-generated assumptions, note skip in project-state.json
- **Any revision request** → revise current step, re-present, wait for approval again
- `project-state.json` is saved **before** showing the checkpoint so no work is lost if the session ends

## Pivoting

When the human says "let's pivot", "wrong customer", "this isn't working" — or when the Step 22 PMF score is below 40% — the Supervisor triggers the pivot protocol.

**A pivot is a partial branch, not a full restart.** The PIVOT-N/ folder has the full 6-phase structure, but only re-runs from the earliest step the new direction invalidates. Steps before that point are copied from the original with a "Carried over" note.

### Restart point by what changed

The Supervisor asks "What changed?" and maps the answer to a restart step:

| What changed | Restart from | Steps carried over |
|-------------|-------------|-------------------|
| Target customer segment | Step 1 | None |
| Problem / pain point (same customer) | Step 3 | 1–2 |
| Solution / positioning (same customer, same problem) | Step 7 | 1–6 |
| Business model / revenue model | Step 9 | 1–8 |
| GTM channel / acquisition strategy only | Step 12 | 1–11 |
| Need different experiments | Step 19 | 1–18 |
| MVP scope only | Step 20 | 1–19 |

### Minor pivot
Re-run specific steps in-place. Save old files as `{name}-v1.md` before overwriting. No new folder.

### Major pivot — folder structure

```
my-project/
  project-state.json              ← original (activePivot → "PIVOT-1")
  PHASE-1-MARKET-SELECTION/
  ...
  PIVOT-1/                        ← partial branch from restart step
    PIVOT-RATIONALE.md            ← why, what changed, restart step, new hypothesis
    project-state.json            ← currentStep = restart step; stepsCompleted = carried-over
    PHASE-1-MARKET-SELECTION/     ← copied from original if steps 1–2 carried over
    PHASE-2-USER-RESEARCH/        ← copied from original if steps 3–6 carried over
    PHASE-3-VALUE-PROPOSITION/    ← fresh if restart ≤ step 7
    ...
  PIVOT-2/                        ← sibling (not nested) if a second pivot is needed
    ...
```

Carried-over files are prepended with: `> ⚠ Carried from original direction — validated and still applicable.`

At Step 22, if PMF < 40%, the Supervisor proactively asks: "PMF threshold not met — do you want to pivot the problem, solution, or segment, or continue to iterate?"

If a second pivot is needed while inside PIVOT-1/, PIVOT-2/ is created as a sibling at the root level — not nested inside PIVOT-1/.

## External Skills — Integration Map

At each step, agents invoke external PM skills to enrich analysis. These require separate plugin installation:

```
claude plugin marketplace add phuryn/pm-skills
claude plugin marketplace add nextlevelbuilder/ui-ux-pro-max-skill
```

## Lenny's Podcast — Research Reference

At each step, agents fetch relevant transcripts from the Lenny Rachitsky podcast archive to ground analysis in real-world expert patterns.

**Base URL**: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ChatPRD/lennys-podcast-transcripts/main/`

**Pattern**: fetch the topic index first to find relevant episodes, then fetch 1-2 episode transcripts for key insights.

| Step | Lenny Topic Index to Fetch |
|------|---------------------------|
| 1-2 | `index/product-strategy.md`, `index/entrepreneurship.md` |
| 3-4 | `index/customer-research.md`, `index/product-management.md` |
| 5-6 | `index/user-experience.md`, `index/customer-research.md` |
| 7-8 | `index/product-strategy.md`, `index/product-development.md` |
| 9-11 | `index/monetization.md`, `index/pricing.md` |
| 12-13 | `index/growth-strategy.md`, `index/go-to-market.md` |
| 14-15 | `index/business-strategy.md`, `index/product-market-fit.md` |
| 16-17 | `index/startup-growth.md` |
| 18 | `index/fundraising.md` |
| 19-21 | `index/experimentation.md`, `index/product-led-growth.md` |
| 22 | `index/product-market-fit.md` |
| 23-24 | `index/engineering.md`, `index/go-to-market.md` |

## Rules

- **Pause after every step** — show checkpoint prompt and wait for approval
- Use **brave-search** and **fetch** for real market data at every research step
- Invoke **external skills** per the integration map above before finalising each step's output
- Fetch **Lenny transcripts** per the reference table to ground insights in real expert patterns
- Generate **specific, detailed content** — no placeholders
- All Excel files: use formulas not hardcoded values, run recalc.py to verify zero errors
- All Word docs: professional formatting (Arial, headers, page numbers, TOC where appropriate)
- All PowerPoint decks: bold visual design, avoid bullet-heavy slides
- Update `project-state.json` **before** showing each checkpoint
